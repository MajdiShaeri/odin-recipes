    <ul> <li>¾ cup fresh cilantro leaves, stems removed
    </li></ul>
    <ul> <li> ½ cup fresh dill, stems removed
    </li></ul>
    <ul> <li> 1 small onion, quartered
    </li></ul>
    <ul> <li>7-8 garlic cloves, peeled
    </li></ul>
    <ul> <li>Salt to taste
    </li></ul>
    <ul> <li>1 tbsp ground black pepper
    </li></ul>
    <ul> <li> 1 tbsp ground cumin
    </li></ul>
    <ul> <li> 1 tbsp ground coriander
    </li></ul>
    <ul> <li> 1 tsp cayenne pepper, optional
    </li></ul>
    <ul> <li> 1 tsp baking powder
    </li></ul>
    <ul> <li> 2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
    </li></ul>
    <ul> Oil for frying
        <li> </li></ul>

        <h2> Instructions:</h2>
        <ol> <li> (One day in advance) Place the dried chickpeas and baking soda in a large bowl filled with water to cover the chickpeas by at least 2 inches. Soak overnight for 18 hours (longer  if the chickpeas are still too hard). When ready, drain the chickpeas completely and pat them dry.
        </li></ol>
        <ol> <li> Add the chickpeas, herbs, onions, garlic and spices to the large bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade. Run the food processor 40 seconds at a time until all is well combined forming a the falafel mixture.
        </li></ol>
        <ol> <li> Transfer the falafel mixture to a container and cover tightly. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or (up to one whole night) until ready to cook.
        </li></ol>
        <ol> <li> Just before frying, add the baking powder and sesame seeds to the falafel mixture and stir with a spoon.
        </li></ol>
        <ol> <li>Scoop tablespoonfuls of the falafel mixture and form into patties (½ inch in thickness each). It helps to have wet hands as you form the patties.
        </li></ol>
        <ol> <li> Fill a medium saucepan 3 inches up with oil. Heat the oil on medium-high until it bubbles softly. Carefully drop the falafel patties in the oil, let them fry for about 3 to 5 minutes or so until crispy and medium brown on the outside. Avoid crowding the falafel in the saucepan, fry them in batches if necessary.
        </li></ol>
        <ol> <li> Place the fried falafel patties in a colander or plate lined with paper towels to drain.
        </li></ol>
        <ol> <li>Serve falafel hot next to other small plates; or assemble the falafel patties in pita bread with tahini or hummus, arugula, tomato and cucumbers. Enjoy!
        </li></ol>
